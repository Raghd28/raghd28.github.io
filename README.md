# üåç Reducing Carbon Emissions for a Better Future  

## Project Description  
This project is a website about reducing carbon emissions and how individuals can contribute to a more sustainable future. The website was inspired by a video of my campus with people moving around. The goal of the website is to encourage awareness of environmental impact while promoting easy, practical solutions for a greener lifestyle.  

### **Concept & Theme**  
The central theme revolves around sustainability and environmental responsibility. The project's purpose it to:  
- Highlight the effects of carbon emissions on our daily lives.  
- Provide educational content on reducing carbon footprints.  
- Emphasize the importance of collective action to ensure a thriving planet.  

The experience I wanted to create is a visually engaging, informative, and thought-provoking website, using a real-world campus setting in order to make the topic feel more relatable.
